# It runs the "good" process in a subshell, which should run for (at least) 3 seconds

# It runs a second process which is supposed to detect the first process running
# Then it sleeps for an additional 3 seconds (necessary) so that the first process
# has time to exit.

# Yeah, it's a set of race conditions, but that's what this pidfile stuff
# is at least supposed to mitigate.
